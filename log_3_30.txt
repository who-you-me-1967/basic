[info] The calibration set seems to not be normalized, because the values range is [(0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0), (0.0, 1.0)].
Since the neural core works in 8-bit (between 0 to 255), a quantization will occur on the CPU of the runtime platform.
Add a normalization layer to the model to offload the normalization to the neural core.
Refer to the user guide Hailo Dataflow Compiler user guide / Model Optimization / Optimization Related Model Script Commands / model_modification_commands / normalization for details.
